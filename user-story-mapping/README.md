Notes for the book User Story Mapping by by Jeff Patton; Peter Economy

# Introduction

The real goal of using stories is shared understanding. 

The goal of product development is to solve problems. 
The goal of using stories is to be able to articulate the problem to facilitate solving the right problem.
Your job is to change the world by solving the right problems.

Build less: **Minimize output and maximize outcome and impact.**

# The Big Picture

Talk and doc. Don't let the words vaporize.

A fundamental truth about software development: there's always more to build than you"ll
have time for. 

# Plan to Build Less

Don't prioritize features--prioritize outcomes.

Differentiator: A feature that set them apart from their competition.
Spoiler: A feature that is moving in on someone else’s differentiator.
Cost reducer: A feature that reduces the organization costs.
Table stakes: A feature necessary to compete in the marketplace.

A minimal viable product is also the smallest thing you could create or do to prove or disprove an assumption.
